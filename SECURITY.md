# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version is supported; however, we are still interested in learning about security vulnerabilities in previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Vulnerabilitis affecting the Krptn module

If your vulnerability affects the code that is installed on peoples devices when they `pip install krptn`, please fill out [this form](https://github.com/krptn/krypton/security/advisories/new).

We also welcome vulnerabilities with no existing exploits. That means, for example, a use of an insecure cipher, that cannot be directly exploited, but is better fixed.
