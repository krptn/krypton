# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version is supported; however, we are still interested in learning about security vulnerabilities in previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Vulnerabilities affecting the Krptn module

If your vulnerability affects the code that is installed on peoples devices when they `pip install krptn`, please fill out [this form](https://github.com/krptn/krypton/security/advisories/new).

We also welcome vulnerabilities with no existing exploits. That means, for example, a use of an insecure cipher, that cannot be directly exploited, but is better fixed.

### Other vulnerabilites

If your vulnerability is not to do with the Python package (e.g.: XSS vulnerability on our website), please follow the below instructions.

Email security vulnerabilities to [security@krptn.dev](mailto:security@krptn.dev).

Please make sure the following information is clearly stated:

- What components are affected?
- PoC - if any (please see our below notice)
- Recommendations on fixes, if any

We also welcome vulnerabilities with no existing exploits. That means, for example, a use of an insecure cipher, that cannot be directly exploited, but is better fixed.

## Vulnerability Publishing

Any published vulnerabilities will be available under the Security tab of affected GitHub repositories. To view them, click on the tab and select advisories under the reporting section.
